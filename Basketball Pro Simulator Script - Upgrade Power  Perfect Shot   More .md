<h1>Basketball Pro Simulator Script - Upgrade Power, Perfect Shot & More</h1>

The new Roblox game *Basketball Pro Simulator* has introduced a functional script featuring three core mechanics: Perfect Shot, Upgrade Speed, and Upgrade Power, which developers consider a foundational set for launch, with plans to expand features in future updates. Since its release a month ago, the game has rapidly gained traction, surpassing one million plays and maintaining a strong online presence. Players aim basketballs at a backboard to earn coins, progress through levels, and unlock upgrades that enhance shot distance, while in-game currency can be spent on cosmetic items like skins, tracks, and target effects to boost multipliers. A freely available script streamlines gameplay, offering players tools to optimize their experience as they advance in this fast-growing virtual sports environment.
